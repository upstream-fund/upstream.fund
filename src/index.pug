  Welcome to the source code of upstream.fund 🎉

  So glad to have you here 🤩.
  A bief info about the idea 💡 behind the project.

  We've all seen the xkcd comic #2347: Dependency (🔗 https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/2347:_Dependency)
  that illustrates how major projects can rely on a little library maintained by a random dude ⚅ in his spare time ⏰.

  The issue goes further than just relying on the maintainer's work, but also shows how projects at the 🔝 rarely
  care about funding 🤑 their own dependencies upstream in their stack of dependencies.

  Another example of the issue has managed to be top news on many news outlets: XV Backdoor 🚪 in 2024, where 
  a malious code was intentionally distributed across Linux hosts due to the lack of resources of the
  solo-maintainer (🔗 https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4).

  The project upstream.fund helps provide funding 💸 for open source software by estabislihing a tree 🌳 of dependencies
  and having donations on the top tickle 💦 down to the dependencies.
