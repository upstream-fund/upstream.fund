<!--Welcome to the source code of upstream.fund 🎉

So glad to have you here 🤩.
A bief info about the idea 💡 behind the project.

We've all seen the xkcd comic #2347: Dependency (🔗 https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/2347:_Dependency)
that illustrates how major projects can rely on a little library maintained by a random dude ⚅ in his spare time ⏰.

The issue goes further than just relying on the maintainer's work, but also shows how projects at the 🔝 rarely
care about funding 🤑 their own dependencies upstream in their stack of dependencies.

Another example of the issue has managed to be top news on many news outlets: XV Backdoor 🚪 in 2024, where 
a malious code was intentionally distributed across Linux hosts due to the lack of resources of the
solo-maintainer (🔗 https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4).

The project upstream.fund helps provide funding 💸 for open source software by estabislihing a tree 🌳 of dependencies
and having donations on the top tickle 💦 down to the dependencies.

Feross pointed out the irony of companies paying thousands for services related to open-source software while contributing little to the maintainers of such software.</p></div><div class="title is-5"><a href="https://medium.com/free-code-camp/between-the-wires-an-interview-with-vue-js-creator-evan-you-e383cbf57cc4">Vue.js and Patreon Funding</a></div><div class="block"><strong>Context</strong><p>Evan You, the creator of Vue.js, shared his journey from childhood in China to developing Vue.js full-time, funded by a Patreon campaign.
